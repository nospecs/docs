## Overview

This guide covers the most common challenges developers face when working with OVADARE and offers solutions to address them effectively.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Conflict Detection Not Triggering**
#### **Symptom**:
- No conflicts are being detected, even when agents act against defined policies.

#### **Possible Causes**:
1. Policies are not properly defined or loaded.
2. The integration between OVADARE and the multi-agent platform (e.g., AutoGen) is incomplete.
3. Agent actions are not being properly reported to OVADARE.

#### **Solution**:
- Ensure policies are defined and loaded using the **Policy Manager**:
  ```
  policy_manager.load_policies_from_file("path/to/policies.json")
  ```
- Verify that the multi-agent platform is configured to send action data to OVADARE.
  Example for AutoGen:
  `ovadare_instance.track(agent_actions)`
- Test with a minimal setup to confirm the conflict detection pipeline works.

### 2. **Resolution Engine Not Responding**
#### **Symptom**:
- Detected conflicts are not being resolved, or resolutions are not applied to agents.

#### **Possible Causes**:
1. The **Resolution Engine** is not properly initialized.
2. Agents are not receiving or applying resolutions.

#### **Solution**:
- Ensure the Resolution Engine is initialized and connected:
  `resolution_engine = ResolutionEngine(agent_registry)`
- Verify agent-side handling of resolutions:
  - Agents should implement the `handle_resolution()` method from the **Agent Interface**.
  Example:
  `agent.handle_resolution(resolution)`
- Check logs for errors or misconfigurations.

### 3. **Agent Communication Issues**
#### **Symptom**:
- Agents fail to communicate or collaborate as expected.

#### **Possible Causes**:
1. Missing or incompatible protocols between agents.
2. Policy restrictions inadvertently blocking agent communication.

#### **Solution**:
- Review the agent communication setup in the multi-agent platform.
- Use the **Agent Interaction Visualizer** to identify communication bottlenecks.
- Update or relax relevant policies using the Policy Manager:
  ```
  policy_manager.update_policy("communication_rules", new_rules)
  ```

### 4. **Integration with AutoGen Failing**
#### **Symptom**:
- OVADARE is not detecting or resolving conflicts when integrated with AutoGen.

#### **Possible Causes**:
1. Incorrect AutoGen configuration for OVADARE integration.
2. Agent actions are not properly reported.

#### **Solution**:
- Confirm that AutoGenâ€™s actions are being logged and reported to OVADARE:
