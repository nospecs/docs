# Sales Strategy Workflow

This tutorial showcases how OVADARE can be utilized to manage multi-agent workflows for creating effective sales strategies.

## Overview

In this scenario, a team of agents is assigned to develop a sales strategy:
- **Market Analyst Agent**: Researches market trends and customer behavior.
- **Competitor Analyst Agent**: Analyzes competitor strategies and pricing.
- **Pricing Strategist Agent**: Develops pricing strategies based on market and competitor analysis.
- **Presentation Designer Agent**: Compiles the findings into a sales presentation.

### Workflow

1. Agents gather and analyze data.
2. They collaborate to develop a cohesive sales strategy.
3. Conflicts, such as data overlap or strategy contradictions, are detected and resolved.

## Detecting and Resolving Conflicts

### Step 1: Initializing OVADARE

Integrate OVADARE with the agent orchestration system:
```
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict_detector import ConflictDetector
from ovadare.resolutions.resolution_engine import ResolutionEngine
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import PolicyManager

conflict_detector = ConflictDetector()
resolution_engine = ResolutionEngine()
policy_manager = PolicyManager()
```

### Step 2: Define Policies

Set rules to govern agent behavior:
```
policy_manager.add_policy({
    'name': 'PricingPolicy',
    'rules': {
        'access_level': 'restricted',
        'resource': 'competitor_pricing'
    }
})
```

### Step 3: Monitoring Agent Actions

Track actions performed by agents:
```
agent_actions = [
    {'agent_id': 'market_analyst', 'action': 'analyze_market', 'resource': 'market_data'},
    {'agent_id': 'competitor_analyst', 'action': 'access_data', 'resource': 'competitor_pricing'},
    {'agent_id': 'pricing_strategist', 'action': 'create_pricing', 'strategy': 'below_market'}
]
conflicts = conflict_detector.detect(agent_actions)
```

### Step 4: Generating Resolutions

Resolve detected conflicts:
```
if conflicts:
    resolutions = resolution_engine.generate_resolutions(conflicts)
    for resolution in resolutions:
        print(f"Resolution: {resolution}")
```
### Step 5: Applying Resolutions

Communicate resolutions back to agents:
```
for resolution in resolutions:
    agent_id = resolution['agent_id']
    corrective_action = resolution['corrective_action']
    autogen_api.apply_resolution(agent_id, corrective_action)
```
