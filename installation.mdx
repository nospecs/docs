## Installation Guide

Follow this guide to install OVADARE and set up your development environment.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed.
- A virtual environment for project isolation (recommended).

---

## Step 1: Install OVADARE

Install OVADARE via `pip`:

```
pip install ovadare
```

---

## Step 2: Verify Installation

To confirm the installation, run the following command in your terminal:

```
-m pip show ovadare
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
Name: ovadare
Version: 0.1.3
Summary: A framework for conflict detection and resolution in multi-agent systems.
Home-page: https://github.com/nospecs/ovadare

```

---

## Step 3: Initialize OVADARE in Your Project

Create a Python script or integrate OVADARE into your existing multi-agent workflow.

Start by importing OVADARE modules:

```
from ovadare.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict_detector import ConflictDetector
from ovadare.resolution.resolution_engine import ResolutionEngine
```

---

## Step 4: Set Up Your Environment (Optional)

To configure OVADARE for advanced features, create a `.env` file in your project directory with custom settings:

```
CONFLICT_STORAGE_FILE=conflicts_data.json
RESOLUTION_STRATEGY=adaptive
```

Install `python-dotenv` to load environment variables:

```
pip install python-dotenv
```

---

## Step 5: Run Example Scripts

Test OVADARE with the built-in example scripts provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nospecs/ovadare). Clone the repository and navigate to the `examples` folder:

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/nospecs/ovadare.git
cd ovadare/examples
python example_integration.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

- **Dependency conflicts**: Run `pip install --upgrade pip` and try installing OVADARE again.
- **Module not found**: Verify the virtual environment is active and OVADARE is installed inside it.
- **Compatibility issues**: Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is being used.

For more help, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](/tutorials/troubleshooting).
