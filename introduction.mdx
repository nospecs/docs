## Welcome to OVADARE

OVADARE is a groundbreaking framework designed to address the growing complexity of **multi-agent systems**. With platforms like **AutoGen** and **CrewAI** revolutionizing how intelligent agents collaborate, the need for conflict detection and resolution has never been more critical.

## Why OVADARE?

In human systems, disputes are often resolved through intermediaries like judges or mediators. Similarly, AI agents—free from social norms and hierarchies—require clear boundaries and mechanisms to handle conflicting goals. OVADARE steps in to:

- Detect potential conflicts in multi-agent workflows.
- Provide actionable resolutions tailored to the specific goals and roles of agents.
- Enhance harmony and efficiency within platforms like AutoGen and CrewAI.
