## Welcome to OVADARE

OVADARE is an open-source framework designed to detect and resolve conflicts between AI agents. It enables smoother collaboration in multi-agent platforms, empowering developers to define boundaries, identify conflicts, and implement resolutions efficiently.

Whether you're using tools like **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, or building your own multi-agent orchestration platform, OVADARE is here to help.

---

## Why OVADARE?

- **Detect Conflicts**: AI agents don’t inherently follow social norms or hierarchies like humans. OVADARE helps identify conflicting behaviors that could disrupt workflows.
- **Resolve Smarter**: Define rules and logic to resolve conflicts between agents based on context, policies, and priorities.
- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Designed to work alongside popular orchestration tools and frameworks.
