  <h1>Welcome to OVADARE</h1>
  <p>
    In the world of multi-agent platforms like <strong>AutoGen</strong>, <strong>CrewAI</strong>, and <strong>LangGraph</strong>, 
    AI agents work collaboratively to perform complex tasks. However, unlike humans, these agents lack built-in social norms 
    or a shared understanding of priorities. This can lead to <span className="highlight">conflicts</span>—situations where 
    agents act at cross-purposes, disrupting workflows and reducing system efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>OVADARE</strong> is here to solve that.
