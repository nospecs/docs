## Welcome to OVADARE

In the world of **multi-agent AI platforms**, where systems like AutoGen and CrewAI orchestrate AI agents to tackle complex workflows, collaboration often encounters roadblocks. Unlike humans, AI agents lack shared social norms, moral frameworks, or hierarchies—essential elements for seamless teamwork.

This is where OVADARE steps in.

OVADARE is an open-source framework built to detect and resolve conflicts between AI agents. By providing tools for conflict detection, resolution strategies, and policy management, OVADARE ensures that AI collaboration remains efficient and aligned with your goals.

## Why OVADARE?

In multi-agent systems, conflicts arise from misaligned goals, overlapping tasks, or unintended consequences of actions. While existing platforms like AutoGen focus on orchestrating workflows, OVADARE adds a critical layer to:

- **Detect Conflicts**: Identify when agents are working at cross-purposes or violating defined boundaries.
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Automatically generate and apply resolutions to keep workflows running smoothly.
- **Define Policies**: Set custom rules to align agent actions with your objectives.

## A Real-World Example

Imagine orchestrating a multi-agent workflow for **Meeting Preparation** using AutoGen. You have agents like:
- `LeadResearcherAgent`: Conducts research on the target company.
- `ProductSpecialistAgent`: Analyzes industry trends.
- `SalesStrategistAgent`: Develops tailored sales strategies.
- `BriefingCoordinatorAgent`: Compiles a comprehensive meeting briefing.

While these agents collaborate, conflicts can occur—duplicate tasks, conflicting strategies, or misuse of resources. OVADARE detects these conflicts, generates resolutions, and ensures seamless execution.
