## Welcome to OVADARE

In a world where AI agents are orchestrated through platforms like [AutoGen](https://autogen.com) and [CrewAI](https://crewai.com), the need for effective collaboration and conflict management has never been greater. OVADARE provides a robust framework for detecting and resolving conflicts between AI agents, enabling seamless multi-agent workflows.

OVADARE acts as the third-party arbiter for AI agents, ensuring that tasks are completed without friction, unnecessary competition, or overlapping roles. By defining conflict boundaries and resolution policies, developers can optimize agent behavior and drive better outcomes.

## Why OVADARE?

- **Conflict Detection**: Identify when AI agents are working at cross-purposes or overlapping in functionality.
- **Resolution Engine**: Generate and implement resolutions for detected conflicts in real-time.
- **Custom Policies**: Define clear boundaries for agent interactions, tailored to your use cases.
- **Platform Integration**: Built to work alongside leading orchestration platforms like AutoGen and CrewAI.
