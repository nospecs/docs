## Welcome to OVADARE

In the world of multi-agent platforms like **AutoGen** and **CrewAI**, AI agents work collaboratively to perform complex tasks. However, unlike humans, these agents lack built-in social norms or a shared understanding of priorities. This can lead to **conflicts**—situations where agents act at cross-purposes, disrupting workflows and reducing system efficiency.

**OVADARE** is here to solve that.

## What is OVADARE?

OVADARE is a framework specifically designed to:
- **Detect conflicts** between AI agents in real time.
- **Resolve issues** through automated recommendations or enforced actions.
- **Learn and improve** through feedback-driven optimization.

By integrating seamlessly with multi-agent platforms, OVADARE ensures AI agents can collaborate more effectively, helping businesses and developers avoid bottlenecks and maximize their workflows.

## Why Use OVADARE?

### The Problem
In multi-agent systems, challenges include:
- **Misaligned goals**: Agents interpreting instructions differently.
- **Competing actions**: Agents working on overlapping or contradictory tasks.
- **Undefined boundaries**: A lack of clear policies guiding agent behavior.

### The Solution
With OVADARE:
- **Detect conflicts** dynamically as they arise in workflows.
- **Apply resolutions** tailored to your system's needs.
- **Improve policies** based on real-world feedback.
