## Resolution Engine

The Resolution Engine is OVADAREâ€™s core component for addressing conflicts detected in multi-agent workflows. Once a conflict is flagged, the Resolution Engine ensures appropriate measures are taken to resolve it efficiently.

### The Role of the Resolution Engine

Multi-agent systems often encounter situations where conflicts must be resolved to prevent disruptions. These conflicts may arise due to:

- **Resource contention**: Multiple agents attempting to access the same resource simultaneously.
- **Policy violations**: Actions taken by an agent that breach organizational or predefined policies.
- **Conflicting objectives**: Agents pursuing goals that are incompatible.

The Resolution Engine acts as a mediator, analyzing conflicts and applying or suggesting resolutions.

### How It Works

The Resolution Engine follows a structured process to address conflicts:

1. **Conflict Intake**: Receives detailed conflict metadata from the Conflict Detector.
2. **Resolution Strategy Selection**: Determines the best approach to resolve the conflict based on predefined policies, historical data, and contextual analysis.
3. **Resolution Application**: Applies the resolution dynamically or recommends an action to the user.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Updates policies or workflows based on the resolution outcome to prevent future conflicts.

### Example Workflow: Meeting Preparation

Continuing with the **Meeting Preparation** scenario from the Conflict Detection example:

#### Conflict Scenario: Resource Contention

The **Sales Strategist Agent** and **Product Specialist Agent** simultaneously request access to a shared analytics tool, exceeding its capacity.

#### Resolution Steps:

1. **Conflict Intake**:
   - The Resolution Engine receives metadata about the conflict (e.g., agent IDs, resource, timestamp).
2. **Analyze Context**:
   - Identifies the nature of the conflict as resource contention.
3. **Apply Resolution**:
   - Assigns prioritized access to the **Sales Strategist Agent** based on urgency and workflow rules.
   - The **Product Specialist Agent** is queued for later access.
4. **Feedback Update**:
   - Updates the policy to include dynamic load balancing for shared resources.
