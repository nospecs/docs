## What is the Resolution Engine?

The Resolution Engine is a core component of OVADARE, responsible for resolving conflicts between AI agents. It generates actionable solutions based on detected conflicts and applies them to ensure the system continues functioning smoothly.

### Why It Matters

Conflicts between agents can disrupt workflows and lead to inefficiencies. The Resolution Engine mitigates this by:
- **Analyzing conflicts**: Determines the root cause of detected conflicts.
- **Proposing resolutions**: Suggests corrective actions based on predefined rules or dynamic inputs.
- **Applying resolutions**: Communicates the resolution back to the system for implementation.

---

## How It Works

1. **Conflict Input**:
   The Resolution Engine receives detected conflicts from the Conflict Detector.
2. **Resolution Generation**:
   Based on predefined rules or dynamic logic, resolutions are created to address the conflict.
3. **Communication to Agents**:
   The proposed resolution is applied by informing the affected agents or modifying their actions.

### Code Example

Hereâ€™s how to use the Resolution Engine to resolve a detected conflict:

```
from ovadare.conflicts.resolution_engine import ResolutionEngine
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict import Conflict
```

# Initialize the Resolution Engine
```
resolution_engine = ResolutionEngine()
```

# Example conflict
```
conflict = Conflict(
    related_agent_id="agent1",
    action={"type": "write", "resource": "fileA"},
    violation_details="Resource contention with another agent",
    policy_id="write_policy_1"
)
```

# Generate a resolution
```
resolutions = resolution_engine.generate_resolutions([conflict])
for resolution in resolutions:
    print(f"Resolution for conflict {conflict.conflict_id}: {resolution.explanation}")
```

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Resolutions**:
  Automatically generates resolutions tailored to specific conflicts.
- **Agent Communication**:
  Applies resolutions by interacting directly with agents or orchestration platforms.
- **Customizability**:
  Developers can define their own resolution logic and strategies.
