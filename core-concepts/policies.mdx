## What are Policies?

Policies in OVADARE define the rules and boundaries that govern agent behavior. They help prevent conflicts by ensuring agents operate within predefined constraints.

### Why Policies are Essential

In multi-agent systems, agents often compete for resources or execute conflicting tasks. Policies:
- Set boundaries for agent behavior.
- Define acceptable actions and roles.
- Act as a guide for resolving potential conflicts.

---

## How Policies Work

1. **Definition**: Policies are defined as sets of rules that specify acceptable actions or roles for agents.
2. **Evaluation**: Agent actions are evaluated against policies during execution.
3. **Enforcement**: Actions that violate policies trigger conflicts, which are handled by the Resolution Engine.

### Code Example: Defining a Policy

Hereâ€™s an example of how to define a read-only policy for an agent:

```
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import Policy
```

# Define a read-only policy
```
read_only_policy = Policy(
    name="ReadOnlyPolicy",
    rules={
        "access_level": "read",
        "resource_limits": "moderate"
    }
)

print(f"Policy defined: {read_only_policy.name}")
```

---

## Applying Policies

1. **Assign to Agents**:
   Policies are linked to agents during initialization to guide their behavior.

```
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import PolicyManager
```

# Initialize the policy manager
policy_manager = PolicyManager()

# Add the policy
policy_manager.add_policy(read_only_policy)

# Assign policies to agents
```
agent_a_policies = policy_manager.get_policies("agentA")
```

2. **Enforce During Execution**:
   When agents perform actions, their behavior is checked against assigned policies to detect violations.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Rules**:
  Define rules specific to your workflow or system requirements.
- **Dynamic Updates**:
  Modify policies in real-time to adapt to changing environments.
- **Centralized Management**:
  Use the Policy Manager to oversee all policies in the system.
