## What is Conflict Detection?

In any multi-agent system, conflicts can arise when agents' actions or policies contradict one another. OVADARE’s Conflict Detection module identifies such scenarios by evaluating agent actions against predefined rules and policies.

### Why It Matters

AI agents lack social norms, moral guidelines, and hierarchical structures that humans rely on. This absence can lead to undesirable behaviors such as:

* Overlapping tasks.

* Resource contention.

* Contradictory actions that impact business goals.

Conflict detection ensures a smooth and cooperative workflow in multi-agent systems.

## How It Works

1. **Action Evaluation**:
   OVADARE intercepts and evaluates actions performed by AI agents within the system.

2. **Policy Matching**:
   Each action is compared against a set of policies defined in the Policy Manager.

3. **Conflict Identification**:
   When an action violates a policy or overlaps with another agent's task, a conflict is flagged.

***

### Code Example

To detect conflicts, OVADARE’s `ConflictDetector` evaluates agent actions dynamically. Here's a basic example:

```
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict_detector import ConflictDetector
```

```
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import PolicyManager
```

# Initialize the ConflictDetector and PolicyManager
```
policy\_manager = PolicyManager()
conflict\_detector = ConflictDetector(policy\_manager=policy\_manager)
```

# Define agent actions

```
agent_actions = [
    {"agent_id": "agent1", "action": {"type": "write", "resource": "fileA"}},
    {"agent_id": "agent2", "action": {"type": "write", "resource": "fileA"}}
]
```

# Detect conflicts

```
conflicts = conflict_detector.detect(agent_id="agent1", action=agent_actions[0])
if conflicts:
    print("Conflicts detected:", conflicts)
else:
    print("No conflicts detected.")
```

***

## Key Features

* **Real-time Analysis**: Evaluates agent actions as they occur.

* **Policy Integration**: Detects violations based on rules you define.

* **Action Logs**: Tracks all actions and flagged conflicts for auditing.

## Next Steps

After detecting conflicts, the next step is to **resolve** them using the Resolution Engine. Learn more about resolution strategies in the [Resolution Engine](resolution-engine) section.
