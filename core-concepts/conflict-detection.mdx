## What is Conflict Detection?

Conflict detection is the heart of OVADARE. It identifies potential issues arising from AI agent interactions in multi-agent platforms like AutoGen or CrewAI. These conflicts occur when agents perform actions that violate predefined policies or attempt tasks beyond their intended scope.

### How OVADARE Detects Conflicts

OVADARE uses its **Conflict Detector** module to monitor and evaluate agent actions in real-time. By integrating with multi-agent orchestration platforms, it can identify conflicts before they escalate.

### Example Scenario

Consider a meeting preparation workflow involving these agents:

- `LeadResearcherAgent`: Gathers insights on a company.
- `ProductSpecialistAgent`: Analyzes product fit.
- `SalesStrategistAgent`: Develops a sales pitch.
- `BriefingCoordinatorAgent`: Compiles the final briefing.

A conflict arises when `SalesStrategistAgent` tries to access restricted product data meant for internal use only. OVADARE detects this by:

1. **Evaluating Actions**: Monitors `SalesStrategistAgent`'s request.
2. **Matching Against Policies**: Checks if the action aligns with predefined access policies.
3. **Flagging Conflicts**: Identifies and flags the violation for resolution.

### Key Features of Conflict Detection

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks agent interactions as they happen.
- **Policy Compliance Checks**: Ensures actions adhere to rules.
- **Detailed Logs**: Provides actionable insights into detected conflicts.

### Using Conflict Detection in OVADARE

To leverage conflict detection, integrate OVADARE into your multi-agent workflow. Hereâ€™s a snippet to get started:

`python
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict_detector import ConflictDetector
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import PolicyManager

# Initialize Policy Manager and Conflict Detector
policy_manager = PolicyManager()
conflict_detector = ConflictDetector(policy_manager=policy_manager)

# Define an example action
agent_action = {
    "agent_id": "SalesStrategistAgent",
    "action": "access_data",
    "resource": "restricted_product_info"
}

# Detect conflicts
conflicts = conflict_detector.detect(agent_id="SalesStrategistAgent", action=agent_action)

# Output conflicts
if conflicts:
    print("Conflicts detected:")
    for conflict in conflicts:
        print(conflict)
else:
    print("No conflicts detected.")
`
