## Conflict Detection

Conflict detection lies at the heart of OVADARE, enabling seamless collaboration among AI agents. By identifying policy violations, misaligned behaviors, and competing objectives, OVADARE prevents conflicts from disrupting multi-agent workflows.

### Why is Conflict Detection Important?

AI agents operate autonomously but lack the inherent social norms and judgment humans rely on. This autonomy can lead to:

- Policy violations (e.g., unauthorized data access).
- Conflicting objectives (e.g., agents competing for shared resources).
- Redundant or contradictory actions.

Conflict detection ensures multi-agent systems remain efficient and aligned with organizational goals.

### How Conflict Detection Works

OVADARE leverages its **Conflict Detector** to monitor and evaluate agent actions in real time. The process involves:

1. **Policy Evaluation**: Actions are checked against pre-defined rules and boundaries set for each agent.
2. **Interaction Monitoring**: Tracks agent-to-agent communication to identify potential contradictions.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Adapts to changing workflows and policies in runtime to maintain relevance.

### Example Workflow: Meeting Preparation

Imagine a team of agents orchestrated via AutoGen for preparing a client meeting:

- **Lead Researcher Agent** gathers company details and industry trends.
- **Product Specialist Agent** prepares product-specific insights.
- **Sales Strategist Agent** develops a custom strategy.
- **Briefing Coordinator Agent** compiles the final document.

#### Conflict Scenario: Policy Violation

The **Lead Researcher Agent** attempts to access restricted data, violating its policy boundaries.

#### Conflict Detection Steps:

1. **Action Logged**: OVADARE logs the agent's attempt to access restricted data.
2. **Policy Cross-Check**: The action is evaluated against its assigned policy.
3. **Conflict Flagging**: A violation is flagged, and metadata (e.g., agent ID, action details, timestamp) is recorded.

### Tools for Conflict Detection

### Next Steps

After identifying a conflict, OVADARE routes it to the **Resolution Engine**, which suggests or applies a resolution to ensure smooth operations.
