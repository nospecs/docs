---

Agents are the core participants in any multi-agent orchestration system. In OVADARE, they are defined, monitored, and evaluated to ensure smooth interactions and compliance with predefined policies. Unlike in orchestration platforms like AutoGen, where agents perform tasks and execute workflows, OVADARE focuses on their interactions and adherence to rules.

## **What Are Agents in OVADARE?**

In OVADARE, agents represent entities whose actions and interactions are monitored for conflicts. OVADARE doesn’t replace agent definitions from orchestration platforms but works alongside them to:

- Monitor agent activities.
- Evaluate their actions against policies.
- Detect conflicts between agents.
- Propose resolutions for smooth collaboration.

## **Agent Components in OVADARE**

OVADARE provides several components to manage agents:

- **`agent.py`:** Defines the `Agent` class, which represents an agent’s capabilities and status.
- **`agent_interface.py`:** Provides the abstract interface that all agents in OVADARE must adhere to.
- **`agent_registry.py`:** A centralized registry for managing agents and their metadata.
- **`agent_sdk.py`:** A utility for platforms like AutoGen to report agent activities and apply resolutions.

## **Do You Need to Define Agents in OVADARE?**

No. Agents are defined in orchestration platforms like AutoGen. However, they must be **registered** in OVADARE for conflict detection and resolution. Registration involves specifying:

- **Agent ID:** A unique identifier.
- **Capabilities:** The actions the agent is allowed to perform.

### **Registering an Agent**
You can register agents programmatically using the `AgentRegistry`:

```
python
from ovadare.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry

registry = AgentRegistry()
registry.register_agent(
    agent_id="sales_agent_01",
    capabilities=["read", "write"]
)
```

This ensures OVADARE knows about the agent and its boundaries.

## **Agent Interaction Workflow**

### **Step 1: AutoGen Reports Activity**
The orchestration platform (e.g., AutoGen) sends agent activities to OVADARE using the SDK:

```
python
from ovadare.agent_sdk import report_action

report_action(
    agent_id="sales_agent_01",
    action={"type": "update", "resource": "client_data", "timestamp": 1700001234}
)
```

### **Step 2: Conflict Detection**
OVADARE evaluates the action against its policies and checks for conflicts.

### **Step 3: Resolution**
If a conflict is detected, OVADARE generates a resolution and sends it back to AutoGen.

---

## **Agent Boundaries**

Agent boundaries in OVADARE are defined through **policies**. For example, a policy might restrict an agent to only “read” operations on certain resources. OVADARE uses these boundaries during conflict detection to evaluate compliance.

---

## **Examples**

### **Scenario: Lead Researcher Agent**
An AutoGen-defined agent `lead_researcher_agent` is registered in OVADARE to monitor its activities.

```
python
# Register the agent in OVADARE
registry.register_agent(
    agent_id="lead_researcher_agent",
    capabilities=["read"]
)

# Report an action to OVADARE
report_action(
    agent_id="lead_researcher_agent",
    action={"type": "write", "resource": "research_notes"}
)
```

If the agent attempts to perform a `write` action but is only allowed to `read`, OVADARE detects the conflict and flags it for resolution.

By focusing on interactions and compliance, OVADARE ensures a seamless and conflict-free environment for multi-agent systems.
