## What are Agents?

Agents are autonomous entities that perform specific tasks or actions within a multi-agent system. In OVADARE, agents are central to workflows, and their interactions are managed to ensure smooth operations without conflicts.

### Types of Agents

Agents in OVADARE can take on various roles depending on the platform and workflow. Examples include:
- **Lead Researcher Agent**: Gathers data on a target.
- **Sales Strategist Agent**: Designs sales approaches.
- **Briefing Coordinator Agent**: Prepares summaries for team meetings.

## Integrating Agents with OVADARE

### Initialization

Agents are registered with OVADARE during initialization, allowing the framework to monitor and manage their interactions.

```
from ovadare.agents.agent import Agent
```

# Initialize an agent
```
agent_a = Agent(agent_id="AgentA")
agent_b = Agent(agent_id="AgentB")

print(f"Agents initialized: {agent_a.agent_id}, {agent_b.agent_id}")
```

---

### Managing Agent Policies

Agents operate based on assigned policies that define their boundaries. These policies ensure they perform tasks without stepping into restricted areas.

```
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import PolicyManager
```

# Assign policies to agents
policy_manager = PolicyManager()
policy_manager.add_policy(read_only_policy)
policy_manager.assign_policy(agent_a.agent_id, "ReadOnlyPolicy")
``

---

### Interactions and Conflicts

Agents interact with each other during workflows, which can sometimes result in conflicts (e.g., overlapping actions or resource contention). OVADARE detects these conflicts and resolves them based on predefined rules.

---

## Monitoring Agent Behavior

OVADARE provides tools to monitor agent activity and their adherence to policies.

```
from ovadare.monitoring.agent_monitor import AgentMonitor
```

# Monitor agent behavior
monitor = AgentMonitor()
monitor.track_agent(agent_a.agent_id)
monitor.generate_report(agent_a.agent_id)
``
