## What are Agents in OVADARE?

Agents are the foundational components in OVADARE. They represent individual AI entities performing tasks, making decisions, and interacting in multi-agent workflows. OVADARE enables developers to define agents, monitor their interactions, and resolve conflicts arising from their activities.

In OVADARE, agents:
- Operate as autonomous entities with defined capabilities and behaviors.
- Interact with other agents, which OVADARE monitors for potential conflicts.
- Adhere to policies that govern their actions and boundaries.

Agent interactions are central to OVADARE's functionality, allowing developers to monitor, detect, and resolve conflicts in dynamic, multi-agent environments.

## Core Features of Agents

### 1. **Agent Definition (`agent_interface.py`)**
The `AgentInterface` defines the structure and required methods for all agents. Implementing this interface ensures that agents are compatible with OVADARE’s conflict detection framework.

```
from ovadare.agents.agent_interface import AgentInterface
from typing import Dict, Any

class ResearchAgent(AgentInterface):
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str):
        self._agent_id = agent_id
        self._capabilities = {"action": "research", "resource": "data"}

    @property
    def agent_id(self) -> str:
        return self._agent_id

    @property
    def capabilities(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return self._capabilities

    def perform_action(self, action: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Example implementation
        return {"status": "success"}
```

---

### 2. **Agent Interactions (`agent_registry.py`)**
OVADARE tracks agent interactions through the `AgentRegistry`. This component monitors registered agents and facilitates interaction logging to detect conflicts.

```
from ovadare.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
from ovadare.agents.agent import Agent

registry = AgentRegistry()

# Register two agents
agent_a = Agent("agent_A")
agent_b = Agent("agent_B")

registry.register_agent(agent_a)
registry.register_agent(agent_b)

# Log an interaction
interaction = {
    "from_agent": "agent_A",
    "to_agent": "agent_B",
    "action": "share_data",
    "details": {"data_size": "100MB"}
}

registry.log_interaction(interaction)
```

---

### 3. **Agent Communication**
Agents can interact directly within workflows. OVADARE captures these interactions and evaluates them against defined policies. For example, if an agent sends restricted data to another agent, a conflict can be flagged.

---

### 4. **Agent Capabilities**
Agents in OVADARE define their capabilities—what they can do and the resources they need. These capabilities are evaluated during interactions to ensure compliance with policies.

```
agent = Agent("agent_123")
agent.capabilities = {"action": "analyze", "resource": "financial_data"}
```

---

### 5. **Agent SDK (`agent_sdk.py`)**
The Agent SDK simplifies creating, registering, and managing agents. It includes utilities for defining agent workflows and integrating with platforms like AutoGen.

---

## Example Workflow: Monitoring Agent Interactions

Here’s how you can define and monitor agent interactions:

```
from ovadare.agents.agent import Agent
from ovadare.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict_detector import ConflictDetector

# Initialize agents
agent_a = Agent("research_agent")
agent_b = Agent("analysis_agent")

# Register agents
registry = AgentRegistry()
registry.register_agent(agent_a)
registry.register_agent(agent_b)

# Simulate an interaction
interaction = {
    "from_agent": "research_agent",
    "to_agent": "analysis_agent",
    "action": "share_data",
    "details": {"data_type": "sensitive"}
}
registry.log_interaction(interaction)

# Detect conflicts
conflict_detector = ConflictDetector()
conflicts = conflict_detector.detect("research_agent", interaction)

if conflicts:
    print("Conflict detected:", conflicts)
else:
    print("No conflicts detected.")
```

---

## Current Limitations

While OVADARE supports defining and monitoring agents, the framework assumes basic structures for agent interactions. Developers need to integrate agents with platforms like AutoGen for advanced orchestration.
