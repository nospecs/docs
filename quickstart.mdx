---

## Quickstart with OVADARE

This guide will help you set up OVADARE in minutes to detect and resolve conflicts in your multi-agent systems.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.7 or higher** installed.
- A multi-agent platform like **AutoGen** integrated with your project.
- OVADARE installed. If not, follow the [Installation Guide](/get-started/installation).

---

## Step 1: Import OVADARE into Your Project

Start by importing the required modules from OVADARE:

```
from ovadare.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict_detector import ConflictDetector
from ovadare.resolution.resolution_engine import ResolutionEngine
```

---

## Step 2: Register Your Agents

Register the agents you want OVADARE to monitor. For example:

```
agent_registry = AgentRegistry()

agent_registry.register_agent(
    agent_id="lead_researcher",
    capabilities={"analyze_data": True, "prepare_reports": True}
)

agent_registry.register_agent(
    agent_id="sales_strategist",
    capabilities={"create_sales_strategy": True, "evaluate_trends": True}
)
```

---

## Step 3: Detect Conflicts

Set up the **Conflict Detector** to analyze actions and identify potential conflicts:

```
conflict_detector = ConflictDetector(agent_registry)

conflicts = conflict_detector.detect(
    agent_id="lead_researcher",
    action={"task": "create_sales_strategy", "resource": "market_data"}
)

if conflicts:
    print("Conflicts detected:", conflicts)
else:
    print("No conflicts detected.")
```

---

## Step 4: Resolve Conflicts

Use the **Resolution Engine** to resolve detected conflicts dynamically:

```
resolution_engine = ResolutionEngine(agent_registry)

resolutions = resolution_engine.generate_resolutions(conflicts)

for resolution in resolutions:
    print("Resolution applied:", resolution)
```
---

## Step 5: Iterate and Improve

Integrate feedback from conflict resolution to refine your policies and improve collaboration between agents. Explore how to define custom policies in the [Policy Management Guide](/core-concepts/policies).
