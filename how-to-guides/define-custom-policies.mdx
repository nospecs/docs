## Introduction

Policies in OVADARE act as guidelines for regulating agent behavior, defining boundaries, and ensuring smooth collaboration within multi-agent workflows. This guide will help you create, manage, and assign custom policies.

## Steps to Define Custom Policies

### 1. Initialize the Policy Manager

The Policy Manager in OVADARE is responsible for handling all policy-related operations. Initialize it as follows:

```
from ovadare.policies.policy_manager import PolicyManager

policy_manager = PolicyManager()
```

### 2. Define a New Policy

Each policy is represented by a `Policy` object containing a name and a set of rules. Here's how you can create a new policy:

```
from ovadare.policies.policy import Policy

data_access_policy = Policy(
    name="DataAccessPolicy",
    rules={
        "access_level": "restricted",
        "resource_limits": "moderate",
    }
)
```

### 3. Add the Policy to the Policy Manager

After creating a policy, it needs to be registered with the Policy Manager:

```
policy_manager.add_policy(data_access_policy)
```

### 4. Assign Policies to Agents

Once defined, policies can be assigned to agents, regulating their actions. Here's an example:

```
from ovadare.agents.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(agent_id="Agent001")
agent.assign_policy(data_access_policy)
```

### 5. Update or Modify Policies

To make changes to an existing policy, update its rules and reapply it to the Policy Manager:

```
data_access_policy.rules["access_level"] = "read-only"
policy_manager.update_policy(data_access_policy)
```

### 6. Remove a Policy

If a policy is no longer needed, it can be removed as follows:

```
policy_manager.remove_policy("DataAccessPolicy")
```

## Practical Tips

- **Define Clear Objectives**: Ensure every policy has a specific purpose and aligns with organizational goals.
- **Audit Regularly**: Periodically review policies for relevance and effectiveness.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name policies meaningfully to avoid confusion during assignment.
