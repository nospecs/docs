## Why Define Custom Policies?

Custom policies allow you to tailor conflict detection rules for your specific workflows and agent interactions. Policies ensure that AI agents operate within defined boundaries, preventing conflicts and misalignments.

---

## Creating a Policy

Use OVADARE's `PolicyManager` to define and manage custom policies.

```
from ovadare.policies import PolicyManager, Policy

# Initialize the Policy Manager
policy_manager = PolicyManager()

# Create a new policy
no_duplicate_tasks = Policy(
    name="NoDuplicateTasks",
    rules={
        "task_assignment": "unique_per_agent"
    }
)

# Add the policy to the manager
policy_manager.add_policy(no_duplicate_tasks)
```

---

## Managing Policies

You can update, remove, or retrieve policies dynamically.

```
# Retrieve a specific policy
policy = policy_manager.get_policy("NoDuplicateTasks")
print("Retrieved Policy:", policy)

# Update an existing policy
policy_manager.update_policy(
    name="NoDuplicateTasks",
    rules={
        "task_assignment": "strictly_unique_per_agent"
    }
)

# Remove a policy
policy_manager.remove_policy("NoDuplicateTasks")
print("Policy removed successfully.")
```

---

## Policy Rules Syntax

Policies are defined as rule-based configurations using JSON-like syntax. Example rules include:

- `resource_allocation`: Prevents agents from overloading system resources.
- `task_overlap`: Ensures no two agents work on the same task simultaneously.
- `access_level`: Limits data or system access based on agent roles.

Example:

```
# Example of defining a complex policy
complex_policy = Policy(
    name="ComplexPolicy",
    rules={
        "resource_allocation": "balanced",
        "task_overlap": "disallow",
        "access_level": "restricted"
    }
)

policy_manager.add_policy(complex_policy)
```

---

## Debugging and Monitoring Policies

Use OVADARE's logging and monitoring tools to debug policy application and refine them over time.

```
# Monitor policies in real-time
policy_manager.monitor_policies()
```

---

Custom policies are the foundation of conflict detection and resolution in OVADARE. By defining and managing these rules, you can ensure smooth and efficient multi-agent collaboration.
