## Why Integrate OVADARE with AutoGen?

AutoGen focuses on multi-agent orchestration and collaboration. By integrating OVADARE, you gain the ability to detect and resolve conflicts between agents, ensuring seamless workflows and preventing bottlenecks.

***

## Prerequisites

* **AutoGen installed:** Follow [AutoGen Installation Guide](https://docs.autogen.com/install).

* **OVADARE installed:** Refer to our [Installation Guide](/get-started/installation).

***

## Integration Steps

### 1. Configure AutoGen to Notify OVADARE of Agent Activities

AutoGen uses event hooks to allow external systems like OVADARE to monitor agent activities. Update your AutoGen configuration to send agent events to OVADARE.

```
from autogen import AgentManager
from ovadare import ConflictDetector

# Initialize AutoGen agents
manager = AgentManager()

# Example agents
lead_researcher = manager.create_agent("LeadResearcher")
sales_strategist = manager.create_agent("SalesStrategist")

# Initialize OVADARE Conflict Detector
conflict_detector = ConflictDetector()

# Register OVADARE as an event listener
manager.register_event_listener(conflict_detector.handle_agent_activity)
```

### 2. Set Policies in OVADARE

Define policies in OVADARE to establish rules for agent behavior. Policies can prevent conflicts like resource overuse or overlapping tasks.

```
from ovadare.policies import PolicyManager, Policy

policy_manager = PolicyManager()

# Define and add a sample policy
no_overlapping_tasks = Policy(
    name="NoOverlappingTasks",
    rules={"task_overlap": "disallow"}
)
policy_manager.add_policy(no_overlapping_tasks)
```

### 3. Detect Conflicts

As AutoGen agents perform actions, OVADARE detects conflicts using the registered policies.

```
# Detect conflicts based on agent activities
conflicts = conflict_detector.detect(
    agent_id="LeadResearcher",
    action={"type": "analyze_data", "resource": "Dataset1"}
)

if conflicts:
    print("Conflicts detected:", conflicts)
```

### 4. Resolve Conflicts

OVADARE generates resolutions for detected conflicts using its Resolution Engine.

```
from ovadare import ResolutionEngine

resolution_engine = ResolutionEngine()

# Resolve detected conflicts
resolutions = resolution_engine.generate_resolutions(conflicts)

# Apply resolutions (e.g., notify agents or adjust actions)
for resolution in resolutions:
    print("Applying resolution:", resolution)
```

***

## Example Workflow: Sales Meeting Preparation

1. **Agents:** AutoGen orchestrates agents like LeadResearcher and SalesStrategist.

2. **Conflict:** Both agents attempt to access the same data resource simultaneously.

3. **Detection:** OVADARE detects the resource conflict.

4. **Resolution:** OVADARE generates a resolution (e.g., schedule resource access sequentially) and applies it back to AutoGen.

Integrating OVADARE with AutoGen bridges collaboration with intelligent conflict management, ensuring smoother workflows and better results.
