## Introduction

OVADARE provides flexibility to customize resolution strategies, enabling developers to define tailored responses to conflicts based on the unique requirements of their multi-agent systems. This guide walks you through configuring and applying custom resolution strategies.

## Steps for Customizing Resolutions

### 1. Define Custom Resolution Logic

Create a custom function to handle resolutions. This function should adhere to your specific conflict resolution requirements:

```
from ovadare.conflicts.resolution import Resolution

def custom_resolution_logic(conflict):
    resolution = Resolution(
        conflict_id=conflict.conflict_id,
        corrective_action={"action": "modify_policy", "details": {"new_policy": "Read-Only"}},
        explanation=f"Conflict resolved by modifying the policy for agent '{conflict.related_agent_id}'."
    )
    return resolution
```

### 2. Extend the Resolution Engine

Integrate the custom resolution logic into the `ResolutionEngine` by subclassing or overriding its default behavior:

```
from ovadare.conflicts.resolution_engine import ResolutionEngine

class CustomResolutionEngine(ResolutionEngine):
    def _create_resolution(self, conflict):
        # Use custom logic for resolution generation
        return custom_resolution_logic(conflict)
```

### 3. Use the Custom Resolution Engine

Replace the default `ResolutionEngine` with your custom implementation to enable tailored conflict resolution:

```
custom_engine = CustomResolutionEngine()

conflicts = conflict_detector.detect(agent_id="Agent001", action={"action": "write_data", "resource": "SharedDoc"})

if conflicts:
    resolutions = custom_engine.generate_resolutions(conflicts)
    custom_engine.apply_resolutions(resolutions)
```

### 4. Apply Resolutions Dynamically

Handle resolutions dynamically by integrating them back into the platform or communicating them to the affected agents:

```
for resolution in resolutions:
    print(f"Applying resolution: {resolution.to_dict()}")
    # Implement platform-specific logic here
```

## Example Workflow

Here’s a practical example of customizing resolutions for an agent action conflict:

```
from ovadare.conflicts.conflict import Conflict
from ovadare.conflicts.resolution_engine import ResolutionEngine

# Example conflict
conflict = Conflict(
    conflict_id="Conflict001",
    related_agent_id="Agent002",
    action={"action": "write_data", "resource": "SharedDoc"},
    violation_details="Policy violation: Unauthorized write attempt.",
    policy_id="Policy001"
)

# Custom resolution
resolution = custom_resolution_logic(conflict)
print(f"Custom resolution generated: {resolution.to_dict()}")
```

## Tips for Customization

- **Agent-Specific Resolutions**: Tailor resolutions for individual agents based on their roles or capabilities.
- **Policy Adjustment**: Dynamically update policies as part of the resolution to prevent future conflicts.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Involve a human reviewer for critical decisions, ensuring that resolutions align with organizational goals.
